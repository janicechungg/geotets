# Setup and Installation

After git cloning the project, cd into the change challenge folder and install the required dependencies using npm install.
Then start the backend server using npm start (localhost:5000) and the frontend server using npm start (localhost:3000).
The application should now be running on http://localhost:3000.


# Reflection

I had a better experience with this year's project because I knew what I was doing. 
It was nice implementing the feedback I got from last year's EKERB project. 
I had a really difficult time figuring out MUI since it was my first time really utilizing.
It was also tricky to get the love bar up-to-date depending on the questions, and I ran 
into a lot of technical errors. I had to consult the internet a lot of times. It also took 
some time to figure out the backend, since it was my first time using an mcq-style API.


# Feedback On Project

I'm not sure if this was deliberate, but the project was very ambiguous. Last year's was
more straightforward, but I appreciated the creative liberty with this one. Though,
I had to think about ways to make my project stick out. I also forgot to do a lot of
commits, so the GitHub repo is not the best reflection of my committing habits.


# Struggles & Inations

If I had more time, I definitely would have added more animations to the game, as well as
implement a database for users. I also want to add more animals and make it so you can collect
different pets. Like I said before, I really struggled with the love-bar and understanding
and implementing MUI.

#IMPORTANT

For convenience, I deployed it on vercel, but sometimes it takes a while to load. 
So if that doesn't work, I guess it has to be run the manual way.
